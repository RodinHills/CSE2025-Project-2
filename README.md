# Binary-Search-Trees
A project about finding all other sequences that yields same binary search tree topology within Data Structers course.

# How it works
Program waits until a sequence entered. After building that binary search tree topology, it finds and stores all possible sequences that builds same binary search tree topology. Program does **NOT** use brute force technic. Sequences are deploying at output.txt file.
